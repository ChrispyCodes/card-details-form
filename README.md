## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow(responsive)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Became more familiar with passing state with props and updating state. Learned more about flexbox and how to arrange content. The most difficult thing was custom validation for adding and removing the error messages, so I created a object called "errorMessages" to manage the state for those and passed it to CardForm.jsx via props and updated it using the spread operator "setErrors({ ...errors }); "
